Here we explore **flexibility signals** embedded in **AlphaFold distograms**, with a special focus on **cryo-EM** interpretation.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Background

AlphaFoldâ€™s distograms encode inter-residue distance distributions that often contain conformational information not visible in final coordinate predictions. In this project, we investigate how these distograms capture hinge-driven conformational flexibility using the AK2:AIFM1 complex as a test case. We compare distogram outputs across AlphaFold versions (AF2, AF2.3, AF3), different sampling strategies (MinnieFold, AF_cluster, and AFsample2), and assess their correspondence with molecular dynamics simulations.

**Visualize hinge motion distograms**

Use the provided Jupyter notebook to reproduce key figures in the manuscript, such as distogram plotting:
```
plot_all_distograms_in_directory(
    "/path/to/distograms",
    res_i=res_i,
    res_j=res_j,
    title=f"AK2 Distogram: Residue {res_i} vs {res_j}"
)
```
**Analyze custom pairwise distances**

Extract pairwise distance distributions for any residue pair (e.g., 230â€“233):
```
python dist-calc-two-res.py --input_pdb /path/to/pdb --residue1 230 --residue2 233
```
